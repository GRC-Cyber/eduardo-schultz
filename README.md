## Description 

This projects consists of building a blog for an author whose only published book is called **Por Culpa Da Madalena**, with focus on _mobile-first approach_.  Here is the link to the [blog](https://srlhyo.github.io/eduardo-schultz/). Also, it is imporan

For this project, I have used a new technology (JavaScript) that allow the page a pop-up and the users to close it after reading. There are some Javascript libraries that would achieve the same thing a lot quicker, with less code, but it was interesting to right Vanilla Javascript and understand how eache line of code does in order to get to the solution. 

This time, I have not only commented out and cleaned my code, but I have made sure that the code was validated and beautifuly written. There are great tools online, and for download, which have helped me in the process. It was a lot faster not having to think of writing prefixes for all the need properties, or to get the right code structure while coding, but undeniable valuable to see those tools the code validated, prefixed and structured. They even point out the errors, warnings and suggestions. All that makes you go back to fix, and while fixing, you are learning too. 

Last, but not least, the aproach used is the mobile first approached, as mentioned above and tt has made realise how easy it is to acommodate the pages to the other screen sizes afterwards. With Mobile-first I ended up using less lines of code and a less media-queries, each helps with maintenance. I still need to work on the other screen sizes, though, but the responsiveness is well present.
